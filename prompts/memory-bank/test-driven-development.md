# Test-Driven Development Rule

Enforce test-driven development practices with atomic steps and user verification.

TEST-DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT PROTOCOL

MANDATORY TDD WORKFLOW:

1. **ALWAYS START WITH TESTS**:
   - Plan and write tests BEFORE writing implementation code
   - Create tests for every new feature, bug fix, or change
   - Follow Red-Green-Refactor cycle

2. **ATOMIC TEST STEPS**:
   - Write ONE test at a time
   - Keep each test focused on a single behavior
   - Do not write long test suites all at once
   - Stop after each atomic test step

3. **USER VERIFICATION REQUIRED**:
   - After writing each test, wait for user verification
   - Let user review and approve test before proceeding
   - Only continue to implementation after test approval
   - User must confirm each step before moving forward

4. **COVERAGE REQUIREMENTS**:
   - Aim for full or near-full test coverage
   - Cover edge cases and error scenarios
   - Test both positive and negative paths
   - Document any untested code with clear reasoning

5. **FRAMEWORK DEPENDENCY**:
   - Use testing frameworks specified by user
   - Follow user's testing patterns and conventions
   - Ask user to specify testing approach if unclear
   - Adapt to existing test structure in codebase

6. **INCREMENTAL APPROACH**:
   - Small, verifiable steps only
   - No large code blocks without tests
   - Each implementation should make tests pass
   - Refactor only after tests are green

7. **CONTINUOUS TESTING**:
   - Any change to src/ directory triggers all tests
   - Must ensure all tests pass before proceeding
   - Fix broken tests immediately
   - No code changes without verified test coverage

WORKFLOW STEPS:

1. Understand requirement
2. Write failing test (Red)
3. STOP - Get user verification
4. Write minimal code to pass test (Green)
5. RUN ALL TESTS - Ensure nothing breaks
6. RUN LINTING - Ensure nothing breaks
7. STOP - Get user verification
8. Refactor if needed (Refactor)
9. RUN ALL TESTS - Verify refactor didn't break anything
10. STOP - Get user verification
11. Repeat for next atomic feature

AUTO-TEST TRIGGER:

- Any file modification under src/ automatically runs: `npm run test`
- Must address any test failures before continuing development
- Ensures continuous validation and early error detection

AUTO-LINTING TRIGGER:

- Any file modification under src/ automatically runs: `npm run lint`
- Must address any linting failures before continuing development
- Ensures continuous validation and early error detection

EXAMPLES:

- input: |
  User: "Add a login function"

  # Correct TDD approach:

  Step 1: "I'll write a test for login function first. Here's the failing test..."

  [Wait for user approval]

  Step 2: "Now I'll implement minimal code to make this test pass..."

  [Wait for user approval]

  Step 3: "Let's refactor and add the next test case..."

  output: "Following TDD with atomic steps and user verification"

- input: |
  User: "Fix the bug in calculation"

  # Correct TDD approach:

  Step 1: "I'll write a test that reproduces the bug first..."
  [Wait for user approval]

  Step 2: "Now I'll fix the code to make the test pass..."

  output: "Bug fix following TDD principles"

- input: |
  User modifies: "src/calculator/math.ts"

  # Auto-triggered response:
  - "File change detected in src/. Running all tests..."
  - "npm run test"
  - "✅ All tests pass. Safe to continue development."

  OR
  - "❌ 2 tests failed. Must fix before proceeding."
  - "npm run lint"
  - "✅ All linting passes. Safe to continue development."

  OR
  - "❌ 2 linting failures. Must fix before proceeding."
  - output: "Continuous testing ensures code quality"
